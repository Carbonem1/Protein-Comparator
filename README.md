# Protein-Comparator
Compare annotated primary sequences of proteins

1. Denote your secondary structures in your primary sequence with the following:
    0: Alpha-helix
    1: Beta Sheet
    2: Coil

2. Separate each secondary structure with a whitespace character

3. Create your protein with the annotated sequence as the only argument

4. run the parse() method on your protein

5. run compare(protein_2) to get amino acid matches in the proteins
